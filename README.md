# CodeIgniter 4 Framework

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to the latest version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use GitHub issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.

## mod_xsendfile
## mod_xsendfile

I added this module to xampp to allow files to be sent back to the server 
to display them. This is necessary to restrict access to files for users
that are not logged in and for users that don't own or have privileges to the file.

Add the following to xampp httpd.conf file
LoadModule xsendfile_module modules/mod_xsendfile.so

&lt;IfModule mod_xsendfile.c&gt;\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XSendFile On\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XSendFilePath absolute/path/to/uploads/folder\
&lt;/IfModule&gt;


## FFmpeg Library

I added this library to the project so I can get a thumbnail for video files. 
You can download the library using spark. 

You will also need to download the ffmpeg binaries which you can find [here] (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
Include those binaries in the following directory: projectroot/app/ffmpeg
